# User churn prediction
## Description:
Implemented a Deep Learning / Machine Learning model using Artificial Neural Network and supervised ML models to identify people who might terminate their services with 87% accuracy with min recall rate as the cost of false negative would greater than false positive for churn prediction. To handle the imabalance in the dataset, SMOTE(Synthetic minority over-sampling) technique is used, which generates synthetic data points for the under-sampled class and preventes the model from biasing and overfitting.
